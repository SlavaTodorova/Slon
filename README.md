SLON: Very Good Trasnslation Editor
(automated help for translation and translation editing)

Version 16.03
Released on March 1, 2016

Author: Slava Todorova

---Description---

This is an editor designed for translation purpuses and more specifically for the translation of books and other texts for which translation memories are of little help.
The editor should be self explanatory (there is a help button in the right hand side of the interface) and easy to use.
Not much functionality is provided in this version: given a plain text file in one language, one might start a translation into another language. The editor will provide an environment for the translation process, the main advantage of which is that it is simple. The ready translation will be stored in a plain text document.
